# Static Site Generators (SSGs)
A **Static Site Generator** converts content (usually written in Markdown) into static HTML files.

## Examples of SSGs
- Jekyll
- Hugo
- Eleventy
- Gatsby

## How They Work
1. You write content in Markdown.
2. The SSG processes templates and themes.
3. The output is a folder of static HTML files.
4. These files can be hosted anywhere — including GitHub Pages.

SSGs are fast, secure, and ideal for blogs, documentation, and small websites.
