# About
This website was created as part of Internet Technologies – Assignment 1.  
The goal is to demonstrate the use of GitHub Pages and the Jekyll static site generator.

GitHub Pages allows hosting static websites directly from a GitHub repository.  
Jekyll converts simple Markdown files into a complete website.
