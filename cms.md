# Content Management Systems (CMS)
A **Content Management System** is a platform that allows users to create, modify, and publish digital content without needing to code.

## Examples of CMS Platforms
- WordPress
- Drupal
- Joomla
- Wix

## CMS vs Static Site Generators

| CMS | SSG |
|-----|-----|
| Dynamic content generated on request | Pre-generated static files |
| Requires a database | No database needed |
| More powerful but heavier | Fast, simple, secure |
| Good for large, interactive sites | Good for blogs and documentation |

GitHub Pages uses **Jekyll**, which is a static site generator.
